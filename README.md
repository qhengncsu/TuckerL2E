Please ensure Matlab 2021a or newer is used.
Please ensure Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox is installed.

1. See demo_simulated_tensor.m for examples with simulated data, this corresponds to section 5.1 in the paper.
2. See demo_fMRI.m for the tensor denoising application, this corresponds to section 6.1 in the paper.
3. See demo_dorrit.m for the Chemometrics application, this corresponds to section 6.2 in the paper.

demo_dorrit.m will run relatively fast, demo_simulated_tensor.m and demo_fMRI.m will take about 5-10 minutes.
